# Twitter-PC-Notifier-
This is a twitter notifiter that brings clickable tweets of your choice to your notification center, Made using tweepy and win10toast libraries 

##requirments
tweepy 4.2.0
a very specific version of win10toast (a fork of the original implemented the ability to click the notification but was failing on install due to requirments conflicts so i searched for forks that worked and got one)
you can install it using
>pip3 install git+https://github.com/WeebMogul/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications
